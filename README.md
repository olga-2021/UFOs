## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to build an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. In order to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings we’ll use previously created  JavaScript and HTML files  and will modify the code in index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter, we’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

If a user accesses the website, he or she will see the basic opening and title with the picture at the top as in the image presented below. Once he or she scrolls down, they should be able to see all the data and filters that are on the web page.

Also, I have created an additional webpage where the user has access to multiple filters: date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments. Multiple filters can be selected at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that has been selected.
